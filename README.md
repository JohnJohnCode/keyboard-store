# KB Store

[This project](https://keyboard-store.onrender.com) was created to showcase my acquired backend knowledge. The goal of this project was to create a library / store of sorts and the theme I have decided to go with, as a true gamer, was keyboards. A user is able to CRUD a keyboard, manufacturers of keyboards and keyboard categories.

As an example one of the keyboards at the time of writing this README is _Logitech K350_ manufactured by _Logitech_ with a price of _27.99$_, with _7 in stock_ and a description of _"Wave design with Constant Curve layout: Curved layout guides hands into just the right position."_

Styling of the project is very simplistic as this project's main focus was, as was already mentioned, on the backend side of things, not frontend.
